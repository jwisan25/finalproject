Goals
I wanted to better understand the trends of movies and genres over time by using their ratings. 

Structure
I used two different tables. One had a ton of movies and their imdb ratings and another had a bunch of the movies a streaming platform carried. 

Questions
I noticed that a lot of "classic" movies were rated a lot higher and I wonder if that is correlation or causation (i.e. the high ratings make the movies popularity or the popularity of the movies creates high ratings)

There weren't any crazy unexpected findings. The only thing was that the directors with the highest ratings were people I didn't really know. 

I have a pretty high threshold for what I consider a good movie, so I was really curious to see what a lot of people thought were really good movies. For the most part it matched up pretty well.
